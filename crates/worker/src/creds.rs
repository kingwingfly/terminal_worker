//! What the authority keeps of processes (owner's plan, 2026-11-02): only each exec's
//! credentials. The process table is each browser's own Durable Object (machine.rs, procs.rs);
//! of all a process's life, only execve needs the filesystem's authority, which checks the
//! image (X, not R), snapshots the caller (root under sudo), and records the snapshot by the
//! hash of the token the process's calls carry from then on. Its forks carry the same token,
//! as they keep its credentials and share its descriptors; the registry revokes it, in
//! batches, once no process holds it.
//!
//! The registry asks here by internal requests, which the Worker never routes from a browser
//! (it routes /api/* alone): `/internal/exec`, `/internal/identity`, `/internal/revoke` and
//! `/internal/tell`. Each carries the browser's cookies, as the request it serves did.
