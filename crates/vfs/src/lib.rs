//! The VFS of the architecture contract (docs/architecture/contract.md §2.2, §2.3), for #48
//! (L1a). Portable: no DOM, `web-sys` or `wasm-bindgen` types, so the browser kernel, a native
//! host and a headless test host run the same code.
//!
//! The names follow Rust's standard library where it has the operation ([`OpenOptions`],
//! [`Metadata`], [`FileType`], [`SeekFrom`], `read_at`, `set_len`, `sync_all`, `lock` and
//! `try_lock`), and the Linux kernel's where it does not (`lookup`, `setattr`, `statfs`,
//! `release`, [`FdTable`]).
//!
//! - A filesystem is a [`Filesystem`] driver, addressed by [`Handle`]s, never by paths. Path
//!   walking, `..`, symlinks and mount crossings belong to the client (§2.3); a driver resolves
//!   one name at a time ([`Filesystem::lookup`]) or several within itself ([`Filesystem::walk`]).
//! - Every call names the [`Cred`] acting, and the driver checks it, as Linux checks the
//!   calling process's credentials. The rules are `os_core::inode`'s, which the server's
//!   kernel shares.
//! - [`Filesystem::open`] and [`Filesystem::create`] return an [`OpenRef`]: the driver's open
//!   reference, which records the credential and access granted at open. Reads and writes
//!   through it check only that access (§2.3).
//! - [`FileRef`] is a counted reference to an open file description ([`File`], Linux's
//!   `struct file`), and [`FdTable`] is one process's descriptors, whatever the driver behind
//!   them.
//! - [`memfs`] is a complete in-memory driver: the reference the other drivers are tested
//!   against, and the instance's tmpfs.
